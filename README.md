# GameVerse-HTML-CSS

A modern gaming platform website built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🎮 About
An interactive gaming website featuring smooth animations and modern UI design. This project demonstrates fundamental web development skills with professional-grade animations and responsive design using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## ⚠️ Important Note
I initially built this project using only HTML/CSS/JavaScript, but when I deployed it, 
I discovered significant browser compatibility issues. The main problem was with `animation-timeline: view`() - a CSS feature that's part of the **CSS Scroll-driven Animations** specification, which only works on desktop Chrome and some other modern browsers. Due to these limitations, I rebuilt the project using React and Vite for better cross-browser compatibility and more flexible animation control.
